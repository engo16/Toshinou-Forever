</p>

A tool/bot for a browser flash game named DarkOrbit.<br />
It does some pretty neat stuff and is still under development.<br />
The tool was originally created by [freshek](https://github.com/freshstudio), but has been modified and updated by a lot of different people since [freshek](https://github.com/freshstudio) abandoned it.<br />
There's a **HIGH RISK OF BAN**, and i don't recommend you using it on an account you don't want to lose.<br />
